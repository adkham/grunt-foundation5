This is a template to start your own project that uses Grunt, Foundation5 and compass

## Requirements

You'll need to have the following items installed before continuing.

  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer provided on the NodeJS website.
  * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): Run `[sudo] npm install -g grunt-cli`

## Quickstart

```bash
git https://github.com/signalkuppe/grunt-foundation5.git
npm install && bower install && grunt && grunt listen
```
